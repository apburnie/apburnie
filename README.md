### About

I am a Product Engineer with a PhD in AI applications and a track record of building mission-critical systems. These websites bridge the gap between complex digital technologies (such as AI LLMs and Web3 blockchains) and intuitive user experiences. My work has supported companies through USD 310M+ in funding rounds and safely processed over USD 1 billion in transactions.

Below is an accessible list of examples of my work:
