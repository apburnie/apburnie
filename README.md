### About

I'm Andrew Burnie, a specialist in building and designing User Interfaces and websites which transform the value of companies. Frontend technologies I use include JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Vue, Svelte, HTML, CSS, D3.js and ethers.js. Backend technologies I use include Rust, Node.js and Python. These UIs interact with a variety of backend infrastructures which include SQL and NoSQL databases, and REST, RPC and GraphQL APIs. I also design websites and logos using Figma, GIMP and Inkscape. 

Currently I am pushing the bleeding edge of what can be done in the frontend using Rust to create more secure, lower-latency websites.

My USP is that I have worked with a vast range of different marketing requirements and different backend requirements from small companies to large, and in each case the website I have created has been used to raise millions of US Dollars in funding.
